# tournament-creator
<h1>About the app</h1>
The app is supposed to help in creating and keeping track of tournaments of any type. For example, it might come in handy when you organize a FIFA tournament with your friends. Right now, it supports two types of tournaments - single elimination tournament (simple bracket, like in NBA Playoffs) or single round robin (all vs. all). You specify the tournament type, name, amount of players participating and the names of the players. Then the application creates a view that lets you edit scores in selected matches. You can also save and load tournaments.

<h1>Goals of the project</h1>
This project was created with 3 main goals in mind:

* Learning Kotlin

* Making the layout and views somewhat nice compared to previous apps

* Publishing the app to the Play Store (still in progress, the app still needs polishing and some debugging)

<h1>Quick overview</h1>
This is how the boring layouts look:


<p float="left" align="center">
  <img src="/readme_assets/main.jpg" width="300"/>
  <img src="/readme_assets/tournament_creation_dialog.jpg" width="300" /> 
  <img src="/readme_assets/changing_players.jpg" width="300" />
</p>


And these are the bread and butter of the app:

  <img src="/readme_assets/bracket_demo.gif" width="300" /> 
</p>
